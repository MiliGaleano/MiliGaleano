<p align="center"><strong>hi!</strong></p>

<p align="center">I'm a graphic designer taking my first steps in this world.<br>I'm mostly interested in front-end development and I love learning something new every day.</p> 

<br><br>
**I can speak:**
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* and now I'm learning React :books:

<br><br>
**Some of my projects:**
* [BLessed App](https://miligaleano.github.io/BLessed-App)
<br>A watchlist app where you can keep track of the things you have watched, make your favourites list and find new things to watch.
* [VacunAr App](https://github.com/MiliGaleano/VacunAr)
<br>An app to keep your Immunization registry organized. Save your vaccination records and find the nearest place to take your next vaccine.
* [My website](https://miligaleano.github.io/MyWebsite/)
<br>That's it :sweat_smile:. Watch my work, know a little about me or leave me a message.
